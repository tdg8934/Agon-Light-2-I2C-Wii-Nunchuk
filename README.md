Wii Nunckuk (serial I2C) with Agon Light 2
Similarity to my previous post for an I2C 3.3vdc LCD originally based on using Richard Turnnidge serial UART assembly/ basic code with a 3.3vdc LCD, voice recognition module and mini thermal receipt printer, I found from Olimex and in my case at Digikey being in the USA, a white original will nunchuk with the UEXT plug adapter 
DigiKey Part Number
1188-MOD-WII-UEXT-NUNCHUCK-ND
Manufacturer
Olimex LTD
Manufacturer Product Number
MOD-WII-UEXT-NUNCHUCK
I found within the MOS API the I2C routines to open, close, write and read using I2C. I’m still new with Assembly language programming on the Agon but can write and read to the 3.3vdc I2C wii nunchuck from the Agon. You can also write or read up to 32 bytes with the I2C MOS API routines. 
My I2C basic code adaptation is still in its infancy but I proved that it works. More in the fire on this to be posted on my GitHub site repository.
I’ll get the code from the screenshots on my GitHub site later.
